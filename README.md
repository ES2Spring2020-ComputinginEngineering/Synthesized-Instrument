# Synthesized-Instrument
Short Description of Project
This project is designed to act as piano keyboard, playing sounds when the user types on his/her keyboard.
To run this project one must install the pynput module, the synthesizer module and the pygame module by typing pip install pynput, pip install synthesizer, pip install pygame into their terminal/commandline.
After that this repository can be cloned and run on any computer.
The repository contains one file called piano that converts your keyboard into a piano.
It implements the keyboard listener from pynput, the synthesizer from synthesizer, and the make_sound() function from pygame.
Please note that while the number of lines of code is short, I did spend a great deal of time dealing with technical issues that came about from an incomplete installation of the updated Python and that I also put a large amount of effort into using as little hard coding as possible which keeps the number of lines down as opposed to hard coding each sound array by hand as I did in piano1.0.
